SDK- Software development kit
It's a programming package comprising a set of software development tools that allows the creation of applications for a certain software framework or a platform or a video game console.
Typically an SDK includes one or more APIs, programming tools, and documentation.

As an example, the JDK (Java Development Kit) contains the API as well as the compilers, runtimes, and other miscellaneous tools. The Java API is simply all the libraries that make up the core language that you can work with out of the box.

There are many SDK's each for different platforms like
Android SDK, Windows SDK etc specific to those platforms
