API- Application program interface 
Simply put, it's the code that allows two software programs to communicate with each other.
API defines the right way to write a program that requests services from an OS or other application.


How APIs work
APIs are made up of two related elements. The first is a specification that describes how information is exchanged between programs, done in the form of a request for processing and a return of the necessary data. The second is a software interface written to that specification and published in some way for use.

The software that wants to access the features and capabilities of the API is said to call it, and the software that creates the API is said to publish it.

Remote APIs:
Remote APIs allow developers to manipulate remote resources through protocols, specific standards for communication that allow different technologies to work together, regardless of language or platform.

Web APIs:
Web APIs are the defined interfaces through which interactions happen between an enterprise and applications that use its assets and typically defined as a set of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request messages, along with a definition of the structure of response messages, which is usually in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.

APIs are one of the most common ways technology companies integrate with each other. Those that provide and use APIs are considered as being members of a business ecosystem.

The main policies for releasing an API are:

Private: The API is for internal company use only.

Partner: Only specific business partners can use the API. For example, car service companies such as Uber and Lyft allow approved third party developers to directly order rides from within their apps. This allows the companies to exercise quality control by curating which apps have access to the API, and provides them with an additional revenue stream.

Public: The API is available for use by the public. For example, Microsoft makes the Microsoft Windows API public, and Apple releases its APIs Carbon and Cocoa, so that software can be written for their platforms.
