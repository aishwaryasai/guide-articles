Markdown is a text to HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy to write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

Simple put, Markdown is two things: 
-a plain text formatting syntax
-a software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text formatting to HTML.

The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

The best way to get a feel for Markdown’s formatting syntax is simply to look at a Markdown-formatted document.

Markdown requires Perl 5.6.0 or later. Markdown also requires the standard Perl library module Digest::MD5 (most commonly used)
