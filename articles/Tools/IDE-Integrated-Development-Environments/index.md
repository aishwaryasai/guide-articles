IDE- Integrated Development Environment
It's a software application that provides facilities to computer programmers for software development. 
An IDE normally consists of:
-source code editor
-build automation tools 
-debugger
Some IDEs, such as NetBeans and Eclipse, contain a compiler, interpreter, or both.
IDE's are maintained for the environment a developer works in.

One aim of the IDE is to reduce the configuration necessary to piece together multiple development utilities. Reducing that setup time can increase developer productivity, in cases where learning to use the IDE is faster than manually integrating all of the individual tools.For example, code can be continuously parsed while it is being edited, providing instant feedback when syntax errors are introduced. That can speed learning a new programming language and its associated libraries.

Some IDEs are dedicated to a specific programming language, allowing a feature set that most closely matches the programming paradigms of the language. However, there are many multiple-language IDEs.

Recent IDE's support multiple languages like C, C++, Java, Python etc (40 or more)

There are both offline and online IDEs.
